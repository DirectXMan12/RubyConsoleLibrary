RubyConsoleLibrary
- An ncurses-/curses-like library for building console applications
-- RubyConsoleLibrary is different from other ruby console libraries in that it is written wholly in ruby, with out any native code required (see below)

- Requirements/Installation -
* if you are on Windows, and are using the default command prompt (or powershell, etc), you must install win32console for this library to work correctly - it adds standard ANSI support to the windows console
* if you are on another platform, comment out the "require 'win32console'" line,[-however, do note that this has not been tested yet on linux, etc, however,-] the aim is to eventually ensure that it is automatically cross-platform (which ncurses isn't really...)
* finally, you may wish to comment out "require 'ruby-debug' 

- Usage -
require 'console-main.rb'
include RubyConsoleLibrary

- Example -
see tester.rb
