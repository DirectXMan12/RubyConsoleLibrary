h1. RubyConsoleLibrary

* An ncurses-/curses-like library for building console applications
** RubyConsoleLibrary is different from other ruby console libraries in that it is written wholly in ruby, with out any native code required (see below)

h3. note: not yet ruby 1.9 compatible (it is more than just changing the constant names from X to RUBY_X - the ascii color support seems to be broken, at lease on Windows 7, and I also get some errors in getch)

h2. - Requirements/Installation -

* if you are on Windows, and are using the default command prompt (or powershell, etc), you must install win32console for this library to work correctly - it adds standard ANSI support to the windows console
* [-if you are on another platform, comment out the "require 'win32console'" line, however, do note that this has not been tested yet on linux, etc, however,-] [+RubyConsoleLibrary will automatically detect a windows installation (looks for WIN32... this has yet to be tested with win64) as+] the aim is to eventually ensure that it is automatically cross-platform (which ncurses isn't really...)
* finally, you may wish to comment out "require 'ruby-debug' 

h2. - Usage -

require 'console-main.rb'
include RubyConsoleLibrary

h2. - Example -

see  the file "tester.rb" in the root directory
